### General rules

Always follow the figma design.
Always use the correct frontend and backend stack.
Always use TDD approach.
Separate the frontend and backend code into different files and directories.

### Frontend rules:

- Always use the correct frontend stack.
- Always separate logic into components and pages.
- Define the common components inside a "components" folder with inside a "common" folder.
- For component variants (like button variants, input variants, etc.), use the class-variance-authority (cva) approach, similar to shadcn.
- If you simply want to create reusable classes to avoid repeating the same Tailwind classes, define them inside the index.css file using @apply.
- In tailwind.config.js, only define custom colors if needed.
- Do not insert svg icons inside pages but define an exported icon component inside the "components" folder with inside a "icons" folder.

### Git rules:

- Main branch is main.
- Pull request are merged into the main branch.
- Feature branches are named feat/name-of-the-feature.
- Bug branches are named bug/name-of-the-bug.
